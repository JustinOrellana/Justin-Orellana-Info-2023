# Is The World of Esports Dying?
 The world of Esports has slowly been losing viewership and has lost some sponsors this year which lead to an org to fall under. Everyone now is asking if Esports is truly the future of gaming and if it is a big cash cow as everyone had anticipated. With the data that is out there that I had collected, I will try to solve if the landscape of Esports is starting to slow down or diminish, it may all be mass hysteria with the recent downfalls in the current year and I would like to test and prove that. 

 The reason for me to do this topic is that it affects a lot of people in the industry of video games as this is a brand new industry that has popped up in the past decades and has amassed a big amount of jobs and people to take in which their livelihood may be on the line. Then I want to answer if people should be worried and if the Esports scene is something that is solid or if will it just wash away in time. 

 The reason other people should be interested in the story is that the Esports industry is to be portrayed as a multi-billion industry that has arisen in the past decade, this is a crazy statement that has been tossed around for a while with the numbers being in 2023 the industry will be worth 385 billion dollars. With that much money to be projected why are people now starting to fear the future for Esports when it was looking so bright? This case for Esports may pave the way for other industries to shine for the better or the worse and may show the population if such industries blowing up at such a rate is a viable thing these days or if we should expect new industries to be dead in the water.

 With the data that is out there, I have gathered data from the span of 1998 to 2023 on the number of earnings that the organizations and the players of those organizations make, the amount that is being sponsored, the amount of prize money in a tournament, the number of players, and the number of organizations. With this data, I will be able to see the function throughout the years and be able to deduce the amount of economy that is flowing through the industry to see if things are truly going downhill.
